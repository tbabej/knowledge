Knowledge is a (Neo)Vim plugin that helps you actually remember what you wrote down in your notes, forever.

To achieve its goal, Knowledge generates flash cards that are piped into the [SRS software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) of your choice (currently Anki and Mnemosyne are supported).
